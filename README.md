This is an assignment for the web development course The Odin Project

IMPORTANT:
Yes, I know that the code is spaghetti and there are many places in which I should have used
relative units in order to make the website more responsive.

Also, I'm still having issues with Git, so the version history and such is all messed up
Hopefully my next repo wont have this issue.

In my defense I coded it mostly during class ðŸ’€
